# Computer Graphics - ESCOM

Practices for the Computer Graphics course at ESCOM made by Alejandro Colin Varela

The practices are all on a library called "Colin3DLibrary" Named like that for obvious reasons.
I added really few examples on how to use it to create a ppm image, they are on the Examples.cpp. I added the Monkey.obj that one example uses.
You have to open and uncomment the example you want to run. Also there are a lot of functions that are not being used on the examples so checking the source code is adviced.

For any more questions you can reach me here on Github or on my Twitter @venado_cosmico
Enjoy!
